# Vehicle-Tracking-System
This project implements a real-time vehicle monitoring system that collects and processes streaming data from vehicles in transit. The system tracks and analyzes various aspects such as vehicle information, GPS coordinates, traffic conditions, weather updates, and emergency/sudden incidents.

While this setup is designed to handle real-time data, for the ease of development and demonstration, the “real-time” data used in this project is synthetically generated within the code. It does not currently ingest data directly from IoT devices or external sensors.

This approach allows for testing and validating the pipeline without requiring a live IoT environment. However, the architecture is fully capable of integrating with real IoT data sources with minimal modifications.
