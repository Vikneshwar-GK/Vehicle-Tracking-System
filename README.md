# Vehicle-Tracking-System
This project simulates a Vehicle tracking system by streaming data from multiple sources like vehicles, GPS systems, traffic cameras, weather stations, and emergency incidents. The project is designed to ingest, process, and store data in a cloud-based ecosystem using Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, Amazon S3, AWS Glue, and Amazon Redshift.

The project aims to showcase how to handle real-time data pipelines in the cloud, with detailed steps for data storage and processing in Amazon S3, AWS Glue Cataloging, and Amazon Redshift integration.
